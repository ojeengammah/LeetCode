Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! Here, you'll find my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems, as well as explanations and insights for each solution.

## About Me

I'm Ojeen Gammah, a passionate programmer and problem solver. I created this repository to document my journey of tackling LeetCode challenges, enhancing my algorithmic and coding skills, and preparing for technical interviews.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized with the following structure:

  - `/ProblemName`: Each LeetCode problem has its own folder named after the problem's title.
  - `solution.py`: My Python solution code for the problem.
  - `README.md`: Additional explanations, insights, and complexity analysis for the solution.

## Why LeetCode?

LeetCode is a fantastic platform to practice and sharpen coding skills. By solving real-world coding problems, I aim to improve my problem-solving abilities and share my knowledge with the community.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have alternative solutions for existing problems or want to add solutions for new problems, I encourage you to get involved. Here's how:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature/new-solution`.
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add solution for ProblemName"`.
4. Push your branch: `git push origin feature/new-solution`.
5. Create a pull request.
